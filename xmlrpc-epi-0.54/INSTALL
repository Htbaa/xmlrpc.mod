XMLRPC Build & Installation Guide

1.	Unpack the archive:

		gunzip -c xmlrpc-epi-x.xx.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

	- or -

		tar -zxvf xmlrpc-epi-x.xx.tar.gz

2.	Configure the sources:

		./configure 
                
        (the install path will be /usr/local by default; 
        libxmlrpc.so will be installed in /usr/local/lib) 
                
	- or -

		./configure --prefix=<install path>

	If you wish to use a system shared expat that is not in the standard location
	of /usr/lib and /usr/include please use the configure option
	--with-expat=<location>

	It is also recomended that if you are installing with --prefix=/usr that
	you also set --includedir=/usr/include/xmlrpc-epi to ensure the header
	files go into a location that does not clash with other system headers.


3.	Build the distribution

		make

4.	Install the Distribution

        (you may have to become root, or choose a different install path above) 
		
                make install
                
                
5.      Build the documentation

                cd src

        (you must have Robodoc installed for this step) 

                make html

	- or -

		make docall
