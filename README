This module allows you to implement an XML-RPC Client and/or server.
Please check out the examples in the example directory. GUI and GUI-Server can interact with each other. Try setting the host in the GUI demo to localhost and try calling the function GetGameList and see what happens. Better start the server first though!

Collaborators are more then wanted to help with the Mac OSX and Linux version of the module.
